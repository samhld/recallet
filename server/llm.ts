export async function parseInputToEntityRelationships(
  input: string,
  username: string,
): Promise<EntityRelationship[]> {
  const prompt = `Parse the following input into entity-relationship triples. The user who wrote this input is "${username}".

Rules:
1. Extract ALL distinct entities and their relationships
2. Use "<user>" to represent the user who wrote the input (${username})
3. Handle possessives properly (e.g., "my girlfriend" becomes "<user>'s girlfriend")
4. Create one triple for each unique relationship between entities
5. Be precise with relationship descriptions
6. Return valid JSON array only
7. SPECIAL RULE: When the input contains entities describing something's properties ("is fat", "is annoying", "is beautiful", "is delicious", "has long arms", "was too tired", "had a good head on his shoulders", "likes to", "loves to", "prefers not to", etc.). If the entity is the user, inject the user into it (e.g. "<restaurant> has delicious food" becomes "<user> says <restaurant> has delicious food").
8. You will produce JSON objects for these entity-relationship triples. A single triple will look like this: {"source_entity": <parsed_source_entity>, "target_entity": <parsed_target_entity>, "relationship": <parsed_relationship>, "aliases": <whether or not the entities are aliases of one another>}
If multiple entity-relationship triples are identified, they should each have a JSON object to represent them according to the schema above. For example:
"I like the color purple, even though Elvis Presley, who I don't really like, really likes purple too" should be parsed into the following array of three JSON objects:
[{"source_entity": "<user>", "target_entity": "the color purple", "relationship": "likes", "aliases": false}, {"source_entity": "<user>", "target_entity": "Elvis Presley", "relationship": "doesn't really like", "aliases": false}, {"source_entity": "Elvis Presley", "target_entity": "the color purple", "relationship": "really likes", "aliases": false}]
9. Support for aliases: When given an input that has an entity-relationship triple in the shape of entity-is-entity (where "is" is used explicitly and the source and target entities are both entities rather than descriptors), set "aliases": true. For example: "Bob is my husband" would be parsed as {"source_entity": "Bob", "target_entity": "<user>'s husband", "relationship": "is", "aliases": true}.

Examples:
Input: "Jake Owen is my favorite country artist"
Output: [{"source_entity": "<user>", "relationship": "favorite country artist is", "target_entity": "Jake Owen", "aliases": false}]

Input: "my girlfriend has a crush on jake owen"
Output: [{"source_entity": "<user>'s girlfriend", "relationship": "has crush on", "target_entity": "Jake Owen", "aliases": false}]

Input: "I love Thomas Rhett and his music is amazing"
Output: [
  {"source_entity": "<user>", "relationship": "loves", "target_entity": "Thomas Rhett", "aliases": false},
  {"source_entity": "<user>", "relationship": "claims music is amazing", "target_entity": "Thomas Rhett's music", "aliases": false}
]

Input: "the food at Mario's is too spicy"
Output: [{"source_entity": "<user>", "relationship": "says is too spicy", "target_entity": "the food at Mario's", "aliases": false}]

Input: "Carie from work is manipulative"
Output: [{"source_entity": "<user>", "relationship": "claims is manipulative", "target_entity": "Carie from work", "aliases": false}]

Input: "the unagi at crazy fish is too saucy"
Output: [{"source_entity": "<user>", "relationship": "says is too saucy", "target_entity": "the unagi at crazy fish", "aliases": false}]

Input: "Bob is my husband"
Output: [{"source_entity": "Bob", "target_entity": "<user>'s husband", "relationship": "is", "aliases": true}]

2. Extract the subject entities that the question is about
3. When "my" is used, the user (<user>) is one entity
4. "Who", "what", "where" questions often seek information about relationships involving the user
5. Handle possessives properly (e.g., "my girlfriend" becomes "<user>'s girlfriend" as a separate entity)
6. SPECIAL RULE: For queries about descriptive claims (asking about what is too spicy, manipulative, etc.), assume the user made those claims. Use "<user>" as the source entity for "claims" relationships.

Rules for relationship extraction:
1. Extract the core relationship/connection being queried
2. Focus on the action, attribute, or connection being asked about
3. Remove question words (who, what, where, when) from the relationship
4. For descriptive queries about claims, prefix with "claims" (e.g., "claims is too spicy", "claims is manipulative")

Examples:
Query: "who will I marry?"
Output: {"entities": ["<user>"], "relationship": "will marry"}

Query: "who are my favorite artists?"
