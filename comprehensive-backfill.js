Relationship: ${sourceEntity} ${relationship} ${targetEntity}

Rules:
1. Create a descriptive sentence that explains the nature of the connection
2. Include context about what this relationship means
3. Make it detailed enough to distinguish from similar relationships
4. Focus on the semantic meaning, not just restating the relationship

Examples:
Input: "sam-test1 loves Thomas Rhett"
Output: "This person has a strong emotional affection and admiration for the country music artist Thomas Rhett, enjoying his music and considering him a preferred performer"

Input: "sam-test1 favorite country artist is Jake Owen" 
Output: "This person considers Jake Owen to be their most preferred and beloved country music performer, ranking him above all other artists in the country genre"
